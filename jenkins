Absolutely! Securing your CI/CD pipeline in Jenkins is definitely important as well.

So to break it down in-depth: first, you want to make sure that Jenkins itself is secured. That means always running the latest version, using strong authentication (like integrating with LDAP or OAuth), and making sure that you limit who has admin access.

Next, think about securing your Jenkins agents. These agents run your build tasks, so you want to make sure they’re also locked down. Use agents that are ephemeral if possible so they don't retain sensitive data. Also, make sure that any secrets or credentials used in your pipeline are stored securely, for example, using Jenkins credentials binding or a secret manager like HashiCorp Vault.

You also want to ensure that your pipeline scripts themselves are reviewed and that you’re not running untrusted code. Implement code reviews for your pipeline definitions and use least privilege principles so that jobs only have the permissions they really need.

In other words, securing your CI/CD pipeline is about securing Jenkins access, locking down your agents, managing secrets carefully, and reviewing your pipeline code. Hopefully that gives you a solid in-depth answer!
