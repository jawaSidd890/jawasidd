Jawahar, since you are preparing for **L1–L2 DevOps / SRE interviews** and already working on **EKS, Kubernetes, CI/CD & microservices**, Service Mesh is a **hot topic** especially for banks & enterprise platforms.
Here are the **most important Service Mesh Interview Questions with Expected Answers** 👇

---

# 🔷 1. What is a Service Mesh?

**Expected Answer:**
A **Service Mesh** is an infrastructure layer that manages **service-to-service communication** inside a microservices architecture.
It provides:

* Traffic management
* Security (mTLS)
* Observability
* Reliability (retries, timeouts, circuit breakers)

It works without changing application code.

Examples:

* Istio
* Linkerd
* AWS App Mesh

---

# 🔷 2. Why do we need Service Mesh when Kubernetes already has networking?

**Expected Answer:**
Kubernetes provides **basic L3/L4 networking** (IP, ports, DNS).
But modern microservices need **L7 features** like:

* Request routing
* Retries
* Rate limiting
* Authentication
* Encryption
* Tracing

Kubernetes **cannot do this natively**.
Service Mesh adds **application-aware networking**.

---

# 🔷 3. What problem does Service Mesh solve?

It solves:

| Problem         | Without Mesh        | With Mesh          |
| --------------- | ------------------- | ------------------ |
| Security        | No encryption       | mTLS               |
| Observability   | Logs only           | Metrics, tracing   |
| Traffic control | Very limited        | Canary, blue/green |
| Resilience      | App handles retries | Mesh handles       |

---

# 🔷 4. What is a Sidecar Proxy?

**Expected Answer:**
A **sidecar proxy (Envoy)** runs alongside each pod and intercepts **all inbound & outbound traffic**.

So:
App → Envoy → Network → Envoy → App

This allows the mesh to:

* Control traffic
* Encrypt traffic
* Collect metrics
  without touching application code.

---

# 🔷 5. Explain Istio Architecture

Istio has two planes:

### Control Plane

* **istiod**

  * Policy
  * Security (certs)
  * Config distribution

### Data Plane

* **Envoy proxies** inside every pod

istiod tells Envoy:

* where to route
* how to secure
* what rules to apply

---

# 🔷 6. What is mTLS in Service Mesh?

**Expected Answer:**
mTLS (Mutual TLS) means:

* Client proves its identity
* Server proves its identity
* Traffic is encrypted

Istio automatically:

* Issues certificates
* Rotates them
* Enforces trust between services

This prevents:

* Man-in-the-middle
* Pod spoofing
* Network attacks

---

# 🔷 7. How does Service Mesh improve security in Kubernetes?

It provides:

* mTLS encryption
* Service-to-service authentication
* Fine-grained authorization
* Zero-trust networking

Even if someone gets into the cluster, they **cannot call services without identity**.

---

# 🔷 8. What is Traffic Management in Istio?

Traffic management means controlling how requests flow:

* Load balancing
* Canary deployment
* Blue/green
* A/B testing
* Fault injection

Example:

* 90% traffic → v1
* 10% traffic → v2

---

# 🔷 9. How do you do Canary deployment using Service Mesh?

You create:

* **VirtualService**
* **DestinationRule**

Example:

```
90% → version v1  
10% → version v2
```

No load balancer change required.
No DNS change required.
Istio handles it at the proxy level.

---

# 🔷 10. What is Observability in Service Mesh?

It provides:

* **Metrics** (Prometheus)
* **Tracing** (Jaeger)
* **Visualization** (Kiali, Grafana)

You can see:

* Which service is slow
* Which one is failing
* How requests flow

---

# 🔷 11. Difference between API Gateway and Service Mesh

| API Gateway                 | Service Mesh              |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Handles North-South traffic | Handles East-West traffic |
| Client → App                | Service → Service         |
| Entry point                 | Internal communication    |

Both are used together in production.

---

# 🔷 12. What is AWS App Mesh?

AWS App Mesh is a **managed service mesh** using **Envoy** that works with:

* EKS
* ECS
* EC2

It provides:

* Traffic control
* Monitoring
* Secure service communication

---

# 🔷 13. What happens when a pod joins Istio?

1. Pod is created
2. Istio injects **Envoy sidecar**
3. Traffic flows through Envoy
4. Istio applies:

   * Routing
   * Security
   * Monitoring

---

# 🔷 14. How does Service Mesh help SRE & DevOps?

It helps in:

* Zero-downtime deployments
* Debugging microservices
* Security compliance
* SLA monitoring
* Traffic control during incidents

Perfect for **banking & enterprise systems** where you are working.

---

# 🔷 15. Real-World Scenario Question

**Q:** A microservice is slow and causing failures. How will Service Mesh help?

**Expected Answer:**
Using Istio:

* I check metrics in **Grafana**
* Traces in **Jaeger**
* Service graph in **Kiali**
  Then:
* Add timeout
* Add retries
* Route traffic to healthy version

No app code change needed.
